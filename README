This is a Web-based timezone map user interface whose purpose is to show
the timezone boundaries (and times inside the boundaries) as they exist
at a specific point in time (rather than typical maps of timezone
boundaries that show the timezone lines on the assumption that nobody is
observing summer time), and to allow the user to choose that specific
time in various ways.


Plans:

overlay on top of google maps terrain tiles?

combine color (red == 12 or 6, orange = 1 or 7, etc.) and light/dark
day/night shading, with labels

hatch the half-hour timezones between the colors
