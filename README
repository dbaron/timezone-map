This is a Web-based timezone map user interface whose purpose is to show
the timezone boundaries (and times inside the boundaries) as they exist
at a specific point in time (rather than typical maps of timezone
boundaries that show the timezone lines on the assumption that nobody is
observing summer time), and to allow the user to choose that specific
time in various ways.


Plans:

combine color (red == 12 or 6, orange = 1 or 7, etc.) and light/dark
day/night shading, with labels


Build instructions:

 * First, get and follow the build instructions in
   https://github.com/dbaron/tz.js and
   https://github.com/dbaron/tzmap.js

 * In a directory served by an Apache server, make a directory structure
   as follows:

   .htaccess from this repository
   index.html from this repository
   tz.js/ from the output/ directory from building tz.js
   tzmap.js/ from the output/ directory from building tzmap.js

   I do this by using:
     ln -s ../tz.js/output tz.js
     ln -s ../tzmap.js/output tzmap.js
   and then running an rsync command that includes the options:
     --filter=". ./rsync-filter" -avzL --delete-delay . [DESTINATION]/
   Be sure to test rsync with -n before doing anything that deletes lots
   of files; the command above deletes everything in [DESTINATION] !
